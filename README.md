Backhouse Founding Engineer Case Study

## Objective
Build a working prototype that allows a Backhouse supply-side partner
(vendor or manufacturer) to monitor the pricing of three SKUs (restaurant
equipment or supplies) across major distributor marketplaces such as
Webstaurant, KaTom, and Restaurant Warehouse.

### Approach
Before developing solutions, I like to ask myself questions about potential challenges and constraints to gain a deeper understanding of the problem. This deeper understanding of the problem allows me to design a proof of concept of how a solution will work. These were the following questions I had:
*  "How can we reference the same product variant across multiple distributor marketplaces if the naming and SKUs across these marketplace sites is most likely different?"
*  "How can we reference the same product variant across multiple distributor marketplaces if the SKUs for each product variant across these marketplace sites is most likely different?"
*  "What if a user enters a non-specific input for a product? (e.g. Keurig Coffee Maker rather than "Keurig K-Mini Plus â€” Black")
*  "What is the workflow of a user's input to price tracking?"
*  "What data visualization should be displayed on the front-end to showcase the pricing history for each SKU?"
